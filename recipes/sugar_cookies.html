        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes while you turn on the oven, prep your baking sheets, and gather your cookie cutters. </li>
            <li>By the time you're ready to roll, the dough will be easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Dust your countertop and rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. </li>
            <li>Roll the dough into an even thickness, about ¼ to ½ inch. Dip the sharp edge of your cookie cutter into flour and cut out shapes. </li>
            <li>Place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving an inch or more of space between the cutouts. </li>
            <li>This space allows the dough to spread slightly and the hot oven air to circulate around each cookie for even baking.</li>
        </ol>
